        p.lead.mb32 Excide is a boutique consulting house founded in 2015 serving small businesses and start-ups in Singapore. Excide performs the role of a Chief Finance Officer (CFO) at a fraction of their salary. This means that small businesses are able to afford the services that are commonly adopted by larger organizations.
        p.lead.mb32 Starting as a small business ourselves, we understand the unique challenges and constraints facing small businesses and start-ups. Combined with our big business expertise and know-how, we blend the best of both worlds to offer solutions that can deliver real business value quickly and effectively for you.
