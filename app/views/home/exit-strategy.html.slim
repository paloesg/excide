          h3.mb-5.type--uppercase What is an Exit Strategy?
        p.lead.m32.pb32 Every business needs to have a contingency plan in the event that the business is not doing so well. An exit strategy is a form of contingency plan that is executed by an investor, trader, venture capitalist or business owner with the purpose of exiting a non-performing investment or closing a business. In this scenario, an exit strategy is to minimise losses. An exit strategy can also be executed when an investment or business venture has met its profit objective, legal reasons or when a business owner or investor is retiring and wants to cash out.
