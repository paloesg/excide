          h4.mb64.uppercase What is IPO
        p.lead.m32.pb32 An initial public offering (IPO) is the first time that the stock of a private company is offered to the public. IPOs are often issued by smaller, younger companies seeking capital to expand, but they can also be done by large privately owned companies looking to become publicly traded.

        p.lead.m32.pb32 If you don't have a CFO or if you have one but the CFO does not have relevant IPO experience; we at SuperCFO step in and act as your Interim CFO to assist you with the entire IPO process. Thereafter, upon completion of the IPO, we assist you in setting up necessary systems and processes to be able to undertake Public Company compliances. And then gradually transition various functions to a full time CFO (existing or new).
        p.lead.m32.pb32 We must mention that SuperCFO commands exceptional experience in assisting companies in listing on AIM (Alternate Investment Market) of LSE (London Stock Exchange) which is a leading Stock Exchange for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEâ€™s).
