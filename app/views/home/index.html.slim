          h4 Funding
          p
            | Funding forms the core of every business whether this funding comes from the pockets of the founders, the funds from venture capitalists, or organic growth. A business that stagnates is a dying business. Every business needs to grow, and maintaining a healthy flow of cash is critical. Is your business truly growing?

          h4 Customers
          p
            | Any business owner’s primary concern would be sales. “Where am I going to get my customers from? How am I going to sustain a healthy pipeline throughout my business? How can I retain my existing customers?” From lead generation, to lead qualification, all the way to even having them refer you more customers, what does your process look like?

          h4 Expertise
          p
            | In a small set-up, resourcing becomes the third but not in any way the least of concerns to a business owner. Being able to find the people with the right talent is one thing, whereas finding the right people is another. “Where should I be looking for the right talent? Should I be doing this task by myself or outsourcing it to someone else? Can I trust that they deliver?”

            p
              | In the Johari window, the quadrant not known to self while known to others, is called the blind spot. It is important for startups and small businesses to identify the critical issues in their blind spot and resolve them before they run out of their financial runway. However, a reluctance to get help or getting the wrong kind of help could worsen the situation.

          p
            | Many consultants jump to offering solutions before even hearing what the problem is. We do not promise a solution before we hear you out and understand your business better. There is nothing more damaging to a business than to administer changes that are based on an inaccurate diagnosis.

          p
            | Once we are certain of your needs, we will provide either affordable off-the-shelf solutions or customised solutions if necessary. Our strength is that we can provide an objective perspective on the financial status of your business as we do not take brokerage fees or equity.
