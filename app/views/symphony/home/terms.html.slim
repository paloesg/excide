        p Please read the Terms of Services carefully. If you have any questions or clarifications, please contact our customer service at support@excide.co.
        p YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BY CHECKING THE BOX AND CLICKING THE “SUBMIT” BUTTON, OR BY USING THE PLATFORM, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT WITHOUT LIMITATIONS AND QUALIFICATIONS. FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE PLATFORM UNLESS YOU ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT.
        p This Terms of Service (this “Agreement”) governs the relationship between you (“you” or “Consultant(s)”) and VFO ASIA PTE. LTD. (“VFO ASIA” or the “Company”), a company incorporated under the laws of Singapore, together hereinafter referred to as the "Parties" and individually, a "Party".
        p VFO ASIA provides you with the opportunity to provide paid consulting services to VFO ASIA Clients (“Client(s)”). These consulting services include but not limited to telephone consultations, face-to-face meetings, project assignments, speaking engagements or other research, consulting or advisory services (“Consultations”). VFO ASIA facilities this introduction between Consultants and Clients. When you are introduced to a Client by VFO ASIA and you take up employment or any engagement with the Client, refer to “Fees, Exclusivity and Non-solicitation”.
        h5 Changes to the Agreement and Notices
        p VFO ASIA may make changes to this Agreement at its sole discretion. Changes will be communicated to you by us posting the new version of the Agreement on the VFO ASIA websites or as otherwise determined by VFO ASIA in its sole discretion and your acceptance of and / or continued use of the VFO ASIA platform or services after such notification of changes to this Agreement will constitute your acceptance of such changes. You may also be asked to reacknowledge and reaccept this Agreement following any material changes.
        h5 Fees, Exclusivity and Non-solicitation
        p You acknowledge and agree that VFO ASIA has the mandate to be the sole representative to you with respect to the Clients that VFO ASIA introduces you for a period of 24 months from the date of introduction.
        p After a bid for a project has been accepted, VFO ASIA will invoice the Client a service charge based on pre-agreed terms. For purposes of transparency, we show all service fees to the Consultant and Client during the bidding process.
        p Further, you and VFO ASIA intend to work together in good faith. You must use VFO ASIA as your exclusive method to request work, directly or indirectly with the Client. During the 24 months period, VFO ASIA will be entitled to a service fee when the Client directly engages the Consultant. In this scenario, the pre-agreed terms will be the higher of the pre-agreed terms and 15% of the total project value.
        h5 Assignment, Acceptance and Scope of Consultations

          li that you are knowledgeable and proficient to take on the project.
        p You may not subcontract or engage any other person to perform Consultations without VFO ASIA's prior written consent.

        p Nothing in this Agreement removes or limits VFO ASIA’s liability for fraudulent misrepresentation, death or personal injury caused by its negligence.
        h5 Indemnity
        p You agree to indemnify and hold VFO ASIA and its officers, directors, and employees harmless from any claim or demand (including but not limited to reasonable legal fees) made by a third party due to or arising out of or related to your violation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement or your violation of any laws, regulations or third party rights.
        h5 Severability
        p Should for any reason or to any extent any provision of this Agreement be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.
